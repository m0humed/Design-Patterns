Here's a professional `README.md` file you can use for a project showcasing **Common Design Patterns in C#** (you can adapt the language if needed):

# 🧠 Design Patterns in C#

This repository is a collection of commonly used **Design Patterns** implemented in **C#**. It’s designed to be a reference and educational resource for developers looking to learn or refresh their understanding of how design patterns are applied in real-world software development.

## 🚀 Purpose

Design Patterns are proven solutions to recurring design problems. This project serves as:

- A practical guide for software engineers, students, and developers.
- A quick reference for interviews or architectural discussions.
- A source of sample implementations for learning and demonstration purposes.

## 🏗️ Patterns Included

The repository is organized into three categories based on the **Gang of Four (GoF)** classification:

### 1. Creational Patterns
| Pattern        | Description                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Singleton      | Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global access point. |
| Factory Method | Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the type. |
| Abstract Factory | Create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. |
| Builder        | Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. |
| Prototype      | Create new objects by copying an existing object (clone).     |

### 2. Structural Patterns
| Pattern        | Description                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adapter        | Convert the interface of a class into another interface expected by clients. |
| Bridge         | Separate abstraction from implementation so they can vary independently. |
| Composite      | Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. |
| Decorator      | Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. |
| Facade         | Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. |
| Flyweight      | Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. |
| Proxy          | Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access. |

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
| Pattern        | Description                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Observer       | Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so when one changes, all are notified. |
| Strategy       | Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.  |
| Command        | Encapsulate a request as an object.                           |
| State          | Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. |
| Template Method| Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation.         |
| Iterator       | Provide a way to access elements of a collection sequentially. |
| Mediator       | Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. |
| Chain of Responsibility | Pass a request along a chain of handlers.           |
